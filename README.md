# COMP313 Assignment 2

## Architecture and Game Loop
Project: Stealth is 2.5D sidescroller. The player's objective is to escape to the end of the level without being seen. The player must use their unique grappling hook to hide from enemies, and use the environment to their advantage.

The player can move in two dimensions, but the game is built in a 3D environment. With this, and alongside camera zoom in and out, we create a sense of depth that appeals to the player.
