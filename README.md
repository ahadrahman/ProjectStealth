# COMP313 Assignment 2

## Architecture and Game Loop
Project: Stealth is a 2.5D sidescroller. The player's objective is to escape to the end of the level without being seen. The player must use their unique grappling hook to hide from enemies, and use the environment to their advantage.

The player can move in two dimensions, but the game is built in a 3D environment. With this we create a sense of depth that appeals to the player. The game is structured to go from left to right, to give the player familiarity with other side scrollers they may have played. Each level is structured to give the player multiple options and pathways, as they have to think outside the box to which way may be advantageous to their goal.

The game loop is to get to the end of each level. If the player is seen, or dies, they will respawn to the start of the level or their latest checkpoint. Therefore, the game loop consists of moving forward in the level, reaching a new area, dying, learning from your mistakes and repeating the process.
